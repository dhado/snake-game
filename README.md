# snake-game
This project is called `Snake Game`.

## Overview
This code is my take on a game of Snake. It imports the Screen, Snake, Food, and Scoreboard classes from their respective modules. It sets up the screen size and background color, creates a snake and food object, and creates a scoreboard object to keep track of the score. It then listens for key presses to control the snake's direction and moves it accordingly. The code also checks for collisions between the snake's head and food or wall or tail. If there is a collision with food, it refreshes the food object and increases the score. If there is a collision with wall or tail, it resets the scoreboard and snake object. Finally, it exits on click.

## Features
